TextField and validation
https://blog.logrocket.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-text-fields-in-flutter/

Difference between TextField and TextFormFiled?
- If you want too perform any validation check on TextField than you need too use TextFormField 
otherwise taking only values than you should use simple TextField 
- Main difference is that using TextFormField you will save you values with validation
- There is no visual difference
